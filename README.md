# JPNHypoMap_2D
Plot Japanese earthquake distribution in 2-D map

This repo stores my personal python notes for learning how to play with python.

## Earthquake catalog
The dataset in this repo includes more than 2.9 million earthquakes basic information (e.g. Date and time, Location, Depth, Size of Magnitude).
These event catalog are compiled by Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).

## 3 different ways to plot earthquakes on the map

### 1. Statistic 2-D map
Simple statistic map

### 2. Interactive 2-D map with sliders
Interactive plots with sliders
We can select the parameter range (e.g. Date, Depth, Magnitude, Plot size, Plot transparency...) with each slider.
I would recommend to change the transparency to detect clustered seismicity.

> Note that this interactive map works only inside of the jupyter notebook.


### 3. Time lapse 2-D map
Time lapsing 2D map.
See the temporal changes of the earthquake location and so on.
